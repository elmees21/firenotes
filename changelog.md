**v1.1**
- Release for Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers.
- A button has been added to the top bar with the ChatGPT icon, clicking on it opens an external window showing the ChatGPT website. The extension does not modify or display the content of the ChatGPT website in any way, the extension is limited to opening the window.
- The design of the dark mode button has been changed, it is now a simple button, before it was a "slider" that worked poorly.
- Now some texts that previously did not have a translation (such as the notice to reset the data, or the open button in an external window) now have a translation thanks to "_locales". Additionally, the extension name and description now vary by language. The size of some icons in the top bar has been slightly changed.
- Version number changed to 1.1
- Updated the "About" section and added the text "ChatGPT is a trademark of OpenAI.".
